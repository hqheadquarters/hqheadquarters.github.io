        <h1>Morley the Intern</h1>
        <a href="mailto:morley@thelemhq.com">morley@thelemhq.com</a>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in Physics &amp Philosophy from Pomona College in June 2020. Below you will find some projects that I have worked on. I'm proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, React, and Python. I'm an ideas person, but more importantly I see them through from conception to completion. And I'm ready to fetch some coffee for you.</p>
        <p>From,</p>
        <p>Morley</p>
